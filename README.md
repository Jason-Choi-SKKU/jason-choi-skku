## Hello World! I'm Jiwon Jason Choi :)

I'm masterâ€™s student at Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.skku.edu/), [Sungkyunkwan University](https://skku.edu/). I'm working for [SKKU IDCLab](https://idclab.skku.edu/) since 2021.05 advised by [Jaemin Jo.](https://github.com/e-)

 My research aims to automate data analysis and presentation to improve data accessibility. This includes: **1)** Representation learning that reflects the semantics of tabular data; **2)** Multimodal generation models for authoring captions and visualizations; **3)** Interactive interfaces that connect data visualization with natural language captions. I'm also interested in modern web development technology.
