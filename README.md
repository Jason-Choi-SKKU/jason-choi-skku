## Hello! I'm Jiwon Jason Choi :)

I'm a master's student at the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://sw.skku.edu), [Sungkyunkwan University](https://skku.edu/). I'm working for [SKKU IDCLab](https://idclab.skku.edu/) since 2021.05 advised by [Jaemin Jo](https://github.com/e-). I received a bachelor degree in [Computer Science Education](https://comedu.skku.edu), [Sungkyunkwan University](https://skku.edu/).

 
My research aims to automate data analysis and presentation to lower the barrier of data analysis tasks. This includes: 1) Mixed-initiative systems that ***connect data visualization and natural language captions*** for data presentation; 2) ***Automatic exploratory visual analytics system*** reflects user intents, data insights, and expressiveness. I'm also interested in modern web development technology.
