## Hello! I'm Jiwon Jason Choi :)

I'm senior undergraduate stundent at Department of [Computer Science Education](https://comedu.skku.edu), and incomning master student at Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cs.skku.edu), [Sungkyunkwan University](https://skku.edu/). I'm working for [SKKU IDCLab](https://idclab.skku.edu/) since 2021.05 advised by [Jaemin Jo.](https://github.com/e-)

 
My research aims to automate data analysis and presentation to improve efficiency of data tasks. This includes: 1) Mixed-initative systems that **connect data visualization and natural language captions** for data presentation; **2)** **Automatic exploratory visual analytics system** reflects user intents, data insights, and expressiveness. I'm also interested in modern web development technology.
